# So You Wanna Learn Flexible Box
(I really need to come up with a different title)

# reveal.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js)

This presentation is built using reveal.js, a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). "Flexbox" is a box model crafted by the CSS working group of World Wide Web Consortium. This presentation is my attempt to show UI developers what this layout module can do and how it makes our projects a bit easier.
